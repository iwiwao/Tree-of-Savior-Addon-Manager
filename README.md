# 'Tree of Savior' Addon Manager

Tree of Savior Addon Manager written in C#, spiritually based on Excrulon's Addon Manager without the Chromium overhead.

This program will query the same repos that Excrulon's manager uses, so all addons that appear within his program will appear in this program as well.  This program does NOT have the addon blocking that his has.
