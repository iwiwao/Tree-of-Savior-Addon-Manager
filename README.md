# 'Tree of Savior' Addon Manager

Tree of Savior Addon Manager written in C#, spiritually based on Excrulon's Addon Manager without the Chromium overhead.

This program will query the iToS and jToS repos from [JTosAddon](https://github.com/JTosAddon/Addons)

Broken addons (Pulled from [JTosAddon's list](https://github.com/JTosAddon/Addons/blob/master/broken-addons.json)) will be shown in a pretty salmon orange, but the downloads will not be blocked.
